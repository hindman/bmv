Remaining issues from testing/refactoring work:

    - Rework failure control.

    - Real command-line testing scenarios:
        - To exercise currently-uncoverable code.
        - To confirm that file system operations are in working order:
            - renaming
            - clobbering
            - creating parents

    ===========

    - Editing pass over code and tests:
        - organization
        - comments
        - naming
        - clarity/simplicity
        - Failure types: assess for consistency, naming, and usage in the code.
        - Reduce testing-code repetition.

    ===========

    - File operations can fail:
        - collecting input paths (eg, missing or unreadable input file-source).
        - writing to log

Project name change:
    - bmv is claimed [emailed maintainer: Nov 2; no reply].
    - Rename to mvs
    - Dependencies: drop attrs; re-create virtualenvs.

road-map: Road map

New validation issues to consider:
    - all paths must be non-empty

Case-change-only renamings.
    - Path(orig).rename(new): works
    - But existence checks do not respect case.

Logging: bootstrap (create $HOME/.bmv).
Logging: list.
Logging: prune.
Logging: undo operation.

Error handling:
    - If plan.rename_paths() raises, user has no idea whether/how-many
      paths were renamed before the failure.
    - One approach is to count N of paths actually renamed before the fail?

Other operations: copy, backup, link, chmod, touch, timestamps.

Option: --row-delimiter [default: tab]
Option: --path-delimiter [default: newline]
Option: --no-strip [default: paths are stripped]

Alternative dryrun output styles: should support the same behavior as input structures.

Complex failure/validation scenarios:
    - prior renaming would make subsequent renaming fail [eg, changing directory path before attempting a file rename]

Preferences.

usage: Usage

Usage components:

    PATHS     : positionals
    SOURCE    : PATHS | --stdin | --file PATH | --clipboard
    STRUCTURE : --rename CODE | --paragraphs | --pairs | --rows | --flat
    OTHER     : all other options

Usage schematic:

    bmv SOURCE [STRUCTURE] [OTHER]

Usage notes.

    User must provide exactly one source for input paths.

    The user must supply zero or one option defining the structure of the input
    path data.

    Structures for input path data:

        - Paragraphs: two Unix-style paragraphs, one for original paths, one for new paths.
        - Pairs: alternating lines (original, new, original, new, etc).
        - Rows: tab-delimited rows (original, tab, new).
        - Flat: original paths, then an equal number of new paths (blank lines irrelevant).

    The --rename option is considered structural:

        - It implies that the input path data consists solely of original paths.
        - The other structural options imply original-new pairs in one form or another.

Old-path and new-path differ for each pair.

Old-paths exist.

New-paths do not exist.

New-paths do not collide among themselves.

Directories of the new-paths exist.

Creating a new virtualenv:

    v='3.9.4'
    deactivate
    pyenv shell $v && pyenv versions
    mkvirtualenv bmv-$v
    pip install -U pip
    pip install -e .[dev,test] && pip list

Activate and run tests:

    - Basic:

        workon bmv-3.9.4
        pytest -s -v tests/

    - With invoke:

        inv test
        inv tox

    - With tox directly:

        pyenv shell 3.9.4  3.8.9  ...
        tox

Version bump:

    - Edit/commit all changes, including CHANGES and README.

    inv bump --kind major|minor|patch

Publish:

    inv dist [--publish] [--test]

Installing from test pypi:

    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ bmv
    pip uninstall attrs short-con
    pip install attrs short-con

Tag file creation:

    inv tags

CLI tools:

  - rename

    - http://search.cpan.org/~pederst/rename-1.9/bin/rename.PL

    - Classic Perl renaming utility by Larry Wall, subsequently maintained
      (perhaps with minor enhancements) by others.

    - The core concept was to use a Perl expression to convert ORIG names to
      NEW names.

  - brn

    - http://search.cpan.org/~swestrup/App-FileTools-BulkRename-0.07/bin/brn

    - Enhancement of the Perl rename tool.

  - perlmv

    - http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-perlmv/bin/perlmv

    - Enhancement of the Perl rename tool.

    - Scriptlets directory where a user could store small bits of renaming
      logic. On the command-line, these common scenarios could be referenced by
      name.

  - pmv

    - http://search.cpan.org/~jv/File-PerlMove-0.06/script/pmv

    - Enhancement of the Perl rename tool.

  - renameutils

    - http://www.nongnu.org/renameutils/

    - Editor mode: open candidate renamings in text file; user edits and quits;
      then renaming occurs.

  - mmv

    - Unix mass move tool. Fairly basic.

    - Very little information available aside from some archived man pages.

  - rnm

    - https://github.com/neurobin/rnm

    - Many features, but nothing I haven't covered already.

    - A long and cryptic set of options, codes, and terminology.
