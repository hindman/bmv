Editing pass:

    - Check for:
        - clarity, simplicity, naming
        - repetition
        - comments
        - problem-handling: short-circuiting, raising, messages.

    - Files:
        - utils.py
        - problems.py
        - plan.py
        - cli.py
        - test_cli.py
        - test_plan.py

Project name change: bmv => mvs.
    - Edit: setup.py [drop attrs].
    - Re-create virtualenvs.

Logging: bootstrap (create $HOME/.bmv).

Clipboard: generalize to avoid MacOS-specific stuff.

User-supplied code for programmatic use: also accept functions.

Better handling of failures during renaming:
    - Assume plan.rename_paths() raises somewhere in the middle.
    - User wants to know what was renamed, what not.
    - Possible plan:
        - Log before starting renaming.
        - Start.
        - Maintain tracking-data on renamings as they occur.
        - Failure happens.
        - Try to log state: failure info and tracking-data.
        - Assemble an exception summarizing what happened.
        - Raise the exception.
        - Tracking-data should be logged regardless of failure or success.

Publish:
    - Documentation:
        CLI help text.
        README covering CLI and programmatic usage [see Usage section in this file].
    - Make repo public.
    - Version bump.
    - Publish.

road-map: Road map
--------

Case-change-only renamings.
    - Path(orig).rename(new): works
    - But existence checks do not respect case.

Other operations:
    - copy: given old-paths, copy them to new-paths.
    - link: given old-paths (sources), create new-paths (links, soft or hard).
    - chmod: given old-paths, apply "new-path" chmod-specs to old-paths.
    - times: given old-paths, apply "new-path" time-specs to old-paths.
    - touch: given old-paths, touch them.

Additional failure control: backup.

Logging operations: list, prune.

Undo renaming, based on log.

Support preferences.
    - switch my pager back to `less`.

Options:
    --row-delimiter [default: tab]
    --path-delimiter [default: newline]
    --no-strip [default: paths are stripped]

Alternative dryrun output styles:
    - same as input structures
    - plus json

Complex failure/validation scenarios:
    - prior renaming would make subsequent renaming fail [eg, changing directory path before attempting a file rename]

--------
usage: Usage
--------

Usage:

    bmv SOURCE [STRUCTURE] [OTHER]

    PATHS     : positionals
    SOURCE    : PATHS | --stdin | --file PATH | --clipboard
    STRUCTURE : --flat | --paragraphs | --pairs | --rows | --rename CODE
    OTHER     : all other options

Notes:

    - Default structure is --flat.

    - The --rename option is considered structural because it implies that the
      input path data consists solely of original paths.

Creating a new virtualenv:

    v='3.9.4'
    deactivate
    pyenv shell $v && pyenv versions
    mkvirtualenv bmv-$v
    pip install -U pip
    pip install -e .[dev,test] && pip list

Activate and run tests:

    - Basic:

        workon bmv-3.9.4
        pytest -s -v tests/

    - With invoke:

        inv test
        inv tox

    - With tox directly:

        pyenv shell 3.9.4  3.8.9  ...
        tox

Version bump:

    - Edit/commit all changes, including CHANGES and README.

    inv bump --kind major|minor|patch

Publish:

    inv dist [--publish] [--test]

Installing from test pypi:

    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ bmv
    pip uninstall attrs short-con
    pip install attrs short-con

Tag file creation:

    inv tags

CLI tools:

  - rename

    - http://search.cpan.org/~pederst/rename-1.9/bin/rename.PL

    - Classic Perl renaming utility by Larry Wall, subsequently maintained
      (perhaps with minor enhancements) by others.

    - The core concept was to use a Perl expression to convert ORIG names to
      NEW names.

  - brn

    - http://search.cpan.org/~swestrup/App-FileTools-BulkRename-0.07/bin/brn

    - Enhancement of the Perl rename tool.

  - perlmv

    - http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-perlmv/bin/perlmv

    - Enhancement of the Perl rename tool.

    - Scriptlets directory where a user could store small bits of renaming
      logic. On the command-line, these common scenarios could be referenced by
      name.

  - pmv

    - http://search.cpan.org/~jv/File-PerlMove-0.06/script/pmv

    - Enhancement of the Perl rename tool.

  - renameutils

    - http://www.nongnu.org/renameutils/

    - Editor mode: open candidate renamings in text file; user edits and quits;
      then renaming occurs.

  - mmv

    - Unix mass move tool. Fairly basic.

    - Very little information available aside from some archived man pages.

  - rnm

    - https://github.com/neurobin/rnm

    - Many features, but nothing I haven't covered already.

    - A long and cryptic set of options, codes, and terminology.
