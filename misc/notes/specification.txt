Major usage patterns: what the user provides:

    Both old-paths and new-paths.

    Just old-paths, plus renaming options.

Mechanisms to supply old/new paths:

    ARGS     # Old-paths only.
    STDIN
    FILE
    CLIP

Structures for paths:

    Paragraphs  # First old-paths, then new-paths.
    Pairs       # Old-path, new-path, etc.
    Rows        # Tab delimited by default

Validations:

    Old-path and new-path differ for each pair.
    Old-paths exist.
    New-paths do not exist.
    New-paths do not collide among themselves.
    Directories of the new-paths exist.

Behaviors:

    # Initial
    Input mechanism: old-paths via ARGS.
    Validations.
    Dryrun mode.

        bmv [--dryrun] --rename 'return ...' --old ...

    # Second
    Input structure: paragraphs, pairs, rows.
    Input mechanism: STDIN, FILE, CLIP.

    # Third
    Path-components in renaming code: path, directory, name, stem, extension.
    Sequence numbering.

    # Fourth.
    Logging.
    Log inquiries.

    # Later
    Case-change-only renamings.
    Remove common prefix/suffix.
    Other operations: copy, backup, link, chmod, touch.
    Validation overrides: clobber, skip-equal, create-dirs.
    Old-path filtering: files-only, dirs-only.
    Alternative dryrun output styles.
    Undo.
