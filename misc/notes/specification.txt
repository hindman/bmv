Usage components:

    PATHS     : positionals
    SOURCE    : PATHS | --stdin | --file PATH | --clipboard
    STRUCTURE : --rename CODE | --paragraphs | --pairs | --rows | --flat
    OTHER     : all other options

Usage schematic:

    bmv SOURCE [STRUCTURE] [OTHER]

Usage notes.

    User must provide exactly one source for input paths.

    The user must supply zero or one option defining the structure of the input
    path data.

    Structures for input path data:

        - Paragraphs: two Unix-style paragraphs, one for original paths, one for new paths.
        - Pairs: alternating lines (original, new, original, new, etc).
        - Rows: tab-delimited rows (original, tab, new).
        - Flat: original paths, then an equal number of new paths (blank lines irrelevant).

    The --rename option is considered structural:

        - It implies that the input path data consists solely of original paths.
        - The other structural options imply original-new pairs in one form or another.

Old-path and new-path differ for each pair.
Old-paths exist.
New-paths do not exist.
New-paths do not collide among themselves.
Directories of the new-paths exist.
